# Accuracy Gains Without Training Your Own Model: Parallel Reasoning for LLM Apps
## Hack The North 2025
By Eugene Cho

This repo serves a compliment to the workshop slides (see `slides.pdf`), containing demo code (warning it was vibe coded! use at your own risk!).


## Setup
1. Create a Python virtual environment with version >=3.10. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html for a tutorial on how to do this.
a. Or optionally, if you have the `uv` Python package manager set up on your device (good for you if you do), you can just run: `uv venv`, `source .venv/bin/activate` and then `uv sync`. :')

2. Take your Cohere API key, and run `export CO_API_KEY=<insert your api key>` in the terminal to set your environment variable.

3. Follow along in `toy_problem.ipynb`!
